<!-- Normal Js Code -->
// var h1 = document.createElement("h1");
// h1.innerHTML = "Hello World";
// document.getElementById("root").appendChild(h1);

<!-- Using JSX -->
// ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello World!!</h1>, document.getElementById("root"));

It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. 
We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. 
JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

JSX produces React “elements”.

React doesnot require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code.
 It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.
